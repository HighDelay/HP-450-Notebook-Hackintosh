# HP-450-Notebook-Hackintosh
 [This laptop](https://support.hp.com/vn-en/document/c03315512) but with i3-3110M CPU

Mac OS Big Sur only

OpenCore 0.9.0

Everything works fine except Wifi, you'll have to buy compatible wifi card

For iServices, generate a new MacBookPro11,1 SMBIOS and replace the existing one in the config.plist **(Do not use the one that I've set up in this EFI)** 

Getting hackintosh to work on old devices such as this laptop is a pain in the ass, so I won't be updating it any time in the future
