# HP-450-Notebook-Hackintosh
 [This laptop](https://support.hp.com/vn-en/document/c03315512) but with i3-3110M CPU

Mac OS Big Sur only

OpenCore 0.9.0

Everything works fine except Wifi, you'll have to buy compatible wifi card

Getting hackintosh to work on old devices such as this laptop is a pain in the ass, so I won't be updating it any time in the future
